INF280b group project: Hotel Reservation system, Team 5
The database consists of 10 related tables that effectively allow the essentials of the booking
process to be implemented. For example, there is such table as Guest, which stores
information about every guest that books a room at the hotel.
The project also includes some sample queries, including subqueries and several types of joins.
